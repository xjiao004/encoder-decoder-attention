# Write the encoder and decoder model
# 
# Implement an encoder-decoder model with attention which you can read about in the TensorFlow [Neural Machine Translation (seq2seq) tutorial](https://github.com/tensorflow/nmt). This example uses a more recent set of APIs. This notebook implements the [attention equations](https://github.com/tensorflow/nmt#background-on-the-attention-mechanism) from the seq2seq tutorial. The following diagram shows that each input words is assigned a weight by the attention mechanism which is then used by the decoder to predict the next word in the sentence. The below picture and formulas are an example of attention mechanism from [Luong's paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/1508.04025v5).

# 
# The input is put through an encoder model which gives us the encoder output of shape *(batch_size, max_length, hidden_size)* and the encoder hidden state of shape *(batch_size, hidden_size)*.
# 
# Here are the equations that are implemented:

# This tutorial uses [Bahdanau attention](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1409.0473.pdf) for the encoder. Let's decide on notation before writing the simplified form:
# 
# * FC = Fully connected (dense) layer
# * EO = Encoder output
# * H = hidden state
# * X = input to the decoder
# 
# And the pseudo-code:
# 
# * `score = FC(tanh(FC(EO) + FC(H)))`
# * `attention weights = softmax(score, axis = 1)`. Softmax by default is applied on the last axis but here we want to apply it on the *1st axis*, since the shape of score is *(batch_size, max_length, hidden_size)*. `Max_length` is the length of our input. Since we are trying to assign a weight to each input, softmax should be applied on that axis.
# * `context vector = sum(attention weights * EO, axis = 1)`. Same reason as above for choosing axis as 1.
# * `embedding output` = The input to the decoder X is passed through an embedding layer.
# * `merged vector = concat(embedding output, context vector)`
# * This merged vector is then given to the GRU
# 
# The shapes of all the vectors at each step have been specified in the comments in the code:
